# commidity-tracker

We are on a mission to acurately track the supply chain of minerals in the world. Why? With the world turning to battery technology, our first thought was to provide insight for sustainability. Minerals like Lithium, Cobalt and Nickel are in high demand because of lithium-ion batteries but we have to know if we can sustain the levels of production required to power our devices, homes, and cars. That is why we have built this dashboard to track mineral commodities and map their trading value and track the demand of these resources. We are currently underway in gathering data to reveal potential bottlenecks in supply, regulated and non regulated mining operations, and future value prices for companies.
