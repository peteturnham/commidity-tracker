Inspiration:Inspiration: As the world is shifting its focus on protecting the environment as well as introducing a global green economy, Battery technology is assumed to be the keystone of the energy transition. 

1.Topic of this Project:

	This project looks at minerals involved in lithium ion production and the companies that operate the mines involved for getting those minerals. This study aims to reflect a company’s worth based on the amount of minerals extracted. We are hopeful to identify trends in rates of extraction.
         The goal is to look into the different components for EV batteries (cobalt, Nickel, lithium etc), locate the plants those minerals get extracted from, the buyers and analyze the commodities price fluctuations as well as buyers stock price throughout the year. Using data focusing on EV vehicles, we also plan to investigate the demand for these commodities.

2. Dataset_1: Mineral Operations of Latin America and Canada/ Africa and Middle East
	*We are going to use the dataset to pinpoint a location on where the plants are and find information about the investors. 
-What can we do with this dataset?
	*We can pinpoint investors, find out what minerals they mine, the amount that was mined, and the mining coordinates.
Dataset_2: CSV File with Different Commodities
		*We can look at the price trend in this dataset. 
Dataset_3: Finnhub API *gives us pricing for that company stock and their stock symbol.

Dataset 4: EV vehicle population *see how many EV’s are in the wild in relation to commodities



3.Visualization: the first idea is to create a map to pinpoint the plants location.
The second visual will display a line chart about buyers stock price and volume fluctuations.

The third visual is a gauge chart that will display commodity inflation percentage variance.
