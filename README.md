Inspiration:Inspiration: As the world is shifting its focus on protecting the environment as well as introducing a global green economy, Battery technology is assumed to be the keystone of the energy transition. 

1.Topic of this Project:

	This project looks at minerals involved in lithium ion production and the companies that operate the mines involved for getting those minerals. This study aims to reflect a companyâ€™s worth based on the amount of minerals extracted. We are hopeful to identify trends in rates of extraction.
         The goal is to look into the different components for EV batteries (cobalt, Nickel, lithium etc), locate the plants those minerals get extracted from, the buyers and analyze the commodities price fluctuations as well as buyers stock price throughout the year. Using data focusing on EV vehicles, we also plan to investigate the demand for these commodities.

Using data sources available in the free public domain, we have created a presentation that shows commodity futre prices and locations of mineral sources.
